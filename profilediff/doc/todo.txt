string metrics:
- longest common subsequence (only addition, deletion)
- hamming distance (only substitution)
- levensthein = all 3
- JaroWinkler and other edit distances: Damerau-Levenshtein, Fuzzy

[X] XmlDifferDepthShuffleTest: non-equal cases

[ ] string metric differ: mark ambiguous matches with diffState or distance
[X] XmlMergerSystemProfilesPerformanceTest - should also work with shuffling differs => missing discriminators ?
    note: whole test can't incorp. shuffling differs since merge results will differ (and some XmlDifferTest cases are order-sensitive)
    explains: attribute changes on e.g. "argument" must be different since the patterns are equal => OK.
    but: under measures: (with dt monitoring), 11 more elements appear with no peer
    e.g. "TransmitFile argument notContains AJAX" measure id. should be peered, why isn't it ? => the "sticky depth"
[x] ? think it is fixed with shuffling fixes. bug: open with jdbc packs, Ctrl+B => very strange results
[X] SOLVED with smallestComparable() stableness: e.g. left side "ria", right side "ria1", "ria2" distance 1 - cannot be stable
[X] StringMetricXmLDiffer: depth is not set to 0 in inner loop, this is needed for some testcase,
    but unnecessarily increased min threshold of XmlDifferSensorRulesTest from 56 to 91.
[X] store DISTANCE in XmlElement/...
[ ] make metric config more flexible 
[X] split tests per ls.threshold
[X] checks for maxMinDist
[x] threshold confable, -1 = use no-thresh.
[X] StringMEtricDiffer: xml.depth!
[-] en-recurse childrenNames
[X] if equal, return 0 (quicker)
[x] shuffle right side - peering not stable?
[X] checkIndices = minIndices form prev round.
[X] XmlDifferFactory -> TestBase.
[X] StringMetricDiffer: bug: on several equal elements, it still reports deletion+insertion insteadof attr change.
e.g. dynaTrace Monitoring.20150105103732.profile.xml:3270
              <argument pattern="com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Attachment" deepobjectaccessor="" capture="false" match="equals" argumentname="" />
              <argument pattern="com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Attachment" deepobjectaccessor="" capture="false" match="equals" argumentname="" />
              <argument pattern="java.io.InputStream" deepobjectaccessor="" capture="false" match="equals" argumentname="" />
=> a change on "com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Attachment" (no matter which one) will not work as attr. change, a change on "java.io.InputStream" works.
   if we have only one "com.atlassian.confluence.pages.Attachment" argument on both sides, it also works => it's the duplication that makes problems for the algo.
   
differ.
[X] =StringMetricXmlDiffer should always compare children recursively, not whole paths on whole document - less comparison
[X] levenshtein: also need makeUniqueNames() with including childrenNames
[ ] childrenNames - combine the two algos.
[ ] differ redesign - bottom-up
[X] reset uniquePath strings. dont show.

[ ] oneway panel: also scroll on non-change parent elements so we can compare insertion/deletion spots in both documents. (like it's done for attr.)
[X] twoway panel: parse: error => text lost.
[ ] twoway panel: merge correct xml => "content not allowed in prolog" ???

feedback
--------

[X] xmldiff: maybe ignore attribute that has been added and is empty, like "deepobjectaccessor"
[X] class/method:pattern. maybe provide a function that extracts an interesting portion so we can peer up
    minor pattern changes... OR: try StringUtils.getLevenstheinDistance for sensor rules here.

[ ] expand tree: if 1 child, expand as well (recursive)
[X] expandInitial: for plugin.xml ... expand downto deepest single-child.
[ ] enumAttributes: show rawPath in headers, not path.
[X] twoway: attribute checkbox left: todo: store checkbox on insertion element only, adapt assertions, ADAPT MODEL TESTS.
[X] HierDecoModel: confable .gif/
[X] first discr => node text.
[-] tooltip -> decomodel
[X] tm - del. - reverse toggle veto
[!] deletion semantic - cannot reverse: highlights, toggleModel
[X] initial sel => properties
[X] all tests - same discr.
[ ] cleanup sysouts - logging? 
[ ] SystemProfileToggleModel: TODO what we can't handle: if whole "agentgroups" tree was added
[ ] onewaypanel: drop "Old value" column where not needed. (or add a checkbox for to hide it)
[ X XmlElementToggleModel: (1) implement measureref, (2) confable class for this model
[ ] XmlDiffer2 experimental approach: assign serial to each distinct attribute map. 
    this serial is part of the path
    root:3/config:2/element:7
    for dynatrace/ ... don't do this for levels 0 and 1
    diffing: binary search other side paths
    there are no attr. changes, only insertions/deletions.
[-] DebugManager - add manual override
[X] make asyinc using Worker: 2way panel: attr. collecting takes a long time
[x] common StringCache test
[X] common. TreeCheckboxManager, TreeExpandAllManager
[X] only lookup "nice" names on level 3, capitalize if not found.
[ ] merger - maybe merge concurrently on substrings... (for safe, not fast)
[-] checkbox: nice names
[ ] gui: add discr. attr and other config
[ ] fast merger: can we fast-merge repeatedly? once slow => very slow
[X] updateHighlight => bug with checkAll
[X] NewProfile1 -> NewProfile2: NewBt1: thresholds added under count.
    bt/measureref:Count:Exceptions:Count => measure:Count:Exceptions:Count 
[!] differ - can we ignore order w/o setting discriminators?
    1) here's how: for ambig. paths, try to peer up perfect attr. matches using permutations.
    1) todo -reorder() - only incr counts at end
    2) sort everything - complete different impl, w/o discriminators - experimental
[X] suggest discr. when reorder()
[X] regression1/bug: element factory + linker
[-] fixed with check-all. select all + toggle => invalidated. need a better concept
[X] maybe cache display names in userObjects
[X] merge panel: stop button!!
[O] big ui change: https://172.16.96.81:8000/svn/repos/CompuwareAPM/info?revision=464849
[O] big ui change: 341fd3ac351d088ba46eebae3d7a2a3c959bec3d
[X] store XmlInput in mainPanel
[X] commands merge+save, merge+open
[-] resultpanel . use progress()
[X] xmlmerger - does too much diff()
[X] one/two - only parse once, reset modelChildren on tab change.
[ ] memtest: use distinct test class. the parameters are bad - OOM twice 
[X] find correct spot (file open) to clearStringCache()
[X] introduce StringCache
[X] Differ very slow for large unmergeable docs (different root)
[ ] DOC
[X] different roots: click => NPE (parent.peer)
[ ] live-merge with real preview with fast merger possible.
[X] merger: make faster : sortby insertionPos, then merge!
[X] tree: show only INS, DEL, ATTR
[X] progressbar indet: UGLY!
[X] fast: at least for attrs, it must be possible
[-] merger bug: attr. first, insertIntoParent always takes all args.
[X] gui: reload function. 
[X] merge panel: ctrl-S shortcut.
[X] XmlLinker: better design:
[X] link feature: toggle logging on element toggle
[X] XmlMergerSystemProfilesTest: case2: attr counts!! has to do with replacing whole tree when empty parent!!! 
[X] drop "original, modified" names. new: base/mod, left/right
[ ] show merged XML in OneWayPanel 3rd tab
[ ] common util: Runner; properties conf; TextTools
[X] test: every element only asked 1 time from Include callback.
[X] resultPanel: show summary counts.
XmlLinker bug:
GEL_Staging.profile.xm Agent Groups - sensor configs. not linked together

>> brandi:
am coolsten waers eigentlich wenn man einfach einen button hat der von 
'links' einen change nach 'rechts' schiebt und dann die rechte sicht updated (sozusagen ein merge im rechten fenster)
ideas:
[X] filter textbox to quickly find elements
[-] merger3: perf: do more insertions in one batch backwards: prevInsertionIndex < insertionIndex

XmlLinker
PROBLEM - parentChanged have no checkboxes, but links can point to a parentChanged (Agent Groups) - how to handle?

BUGS:
[X] OneWay: attributes get duplicated when traversing up
[X] TwoWay: sometimes, the switch to/from change only leaves us with an empty tree
[X] Combined model: doesn't work with build/core/devlocal.
TODO:
[X]: ?xml prolog!!
[X] descendant states: should also be on peer so that sync works in "Change only" mode
[X] test: mergedflag
[X] differ: all/selected attributes
[X] merger: merge selectivley
[-] "negative merge" ? "Forgrt this change"
[-] MergePanel: bug with finding changes in result via uniquePath for e.g. "property" (FEH sysprofile)



[X] MergePanel: parse this <==> apply in mainframe. ATTENTION: also re-load right panel otherwise some changes remain there. CACHE BUG
[-] Changes only: allow for "structure only"
[X] Attribute table: hide "ignored attributes" (checkbox?)
[X] XmlMerger2: simplify: only merge 1 change, then parse again, and so on...
    this will greatly reduce bugs and problems with insert/remove indices.
[-] XmlMerger2: cannot selectively merge children of element that is empty in original due to replace algorithm.
[X] GOT RID OF SAX. merger produces invalid XML for e.g. ant build files
[X] mergepanel: selecting multiple changes left should be reflected in lines highlight.
[-] fix bug when appending lines to line display!
[X] add a swap lef-right function
[X] add test for bug below with not clearing peer
[X] sync selection: also for attributes.
[X] changes only/expand all: dont expand parentAdded
[X] delete checkbox: reverse semantic ? checked <=> will be in result.
[x] save function merge

[X] bug: fixed

gui:
[X] make XML editable and reparsable in separate tab

differ:
[ ] store STRUCTURE change and ATTR change separately

merger:
[ ] only structural merge possible. should we merge attributes ?

lexer:
[X] more specific conf of discrimnator: per path, like 
dynatrace/systemprofile/uemconfiguration/uemdomainconfig/uemdomainthirdparty/uemdomain: domain
measures: id+metricgroup+metric
sensor: key
...
or. can we add children as discr? for sensorgroup, that would work. ONLY POSSIBLE IF ONLY 1 CHILD!
